# Bell_Lapadula_Simulation
The Bellâ€“LaPadula Model (BLP) is a state machine model used for enforcing access control in government and military applications. The model uses multi security level where higher level users cannot write downwards and lower level users cannot read upwards.
This project is a simulation of BLP with Unix style security in CPP.

## Getting started
There are 3 files included salt,shadow and filesimulation text files to simulate Unix Access Control and file system. 
1. Salt stores the username and the salt to be appended in password hashing.
2. Password is hashed using md5 implementation by Frank Thilo's (thilo@unix-ag.org) and stored in shadow file.
3. Records of files are stored in file simulation together with security clearance to simulate BLP model.

## To compile (GNU compiler)
```g++ main.cpp md5.cpp -o FileSystem```

## To Initialise and create an account
```./FileSystem -i```

## To login
```./FileSystem```
